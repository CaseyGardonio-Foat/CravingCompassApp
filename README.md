## API Keys required, not included

Project requires use of MapQuest and DocuMenu APIs. These keys and the file that holds them are not included in this repo, and are necessary to compile and use the app. Please contact me to obtain the keys and directions for using them in the project.

## Framework

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

## Development server

Run `npm install` to download and install Angular (if not already installed). Run `ng serve` for a dev server (note that the private API keys.service.ts file is required; see "API Keys" above for more information.) Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
